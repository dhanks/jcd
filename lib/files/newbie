Character Registration
----------------------
JCD is a bit different from other talkers; we simply do not accept newbies
without proper registration.  It helps keeps the environment and atmosphere
at a higher level and to a large degree keeps out unwelcome visitors.

At this time you will choose the alias you wish to have approved by the
JCD staff.  If staff members are logged in, you may be approved immediately,
if not, your request will be queued and be announced to staff members upon
their login until your request is denyied or accepted.  Either way, you
will be notified via the email address you shall specify during this
registration when staff members are not available.
