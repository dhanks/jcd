Your request has been submitted and queued in the order it was receieved.
Although there are not any staff members available to immediately approve
your request, your entry will be held a maximum of two days before it is
purged.  During these two holding days, at any time when a staff member
logs in, they will be notified of your request, and most likely make a
judgement on the spot.  Once a decision has been reached, you will be
notified regardless of the outcome with instructions on what to do.  Until
then, we ask that you patiently await an email, for there is no use trying
to login before approval, because queued names cannot be used.
