Things that still suck:

TELOPT handling still has a few minor bugs
STREAMs are still wanky
output.c is such a hack I'm ashamed to let anyone see it
split.c is such crack, I'm also ashame to let anyone see it
ELF modules are still a semi-hack, but I'll let you see it
Everything in modules/ is less than a hack
